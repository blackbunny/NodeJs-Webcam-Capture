# Live Webcam Feed Application

This application captures images from your webcam every quarter of a second and displays them on a web page, creating the effect of a live video feed. This can be particularly useful for AI-assisted applications like ComfyUI and similar tools.

## Features

- Captures images from the webcam every 250 milliseconds
- Overwrites the same image file to create a live feed effect
- Serves a web page that continuously refreshes to display the updated image

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- A webcam connected to your computer

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd camshoot
    ```

2. Install the required npm packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Install `fswebcam` for capturing images:
    - On Ubuntu/Debian:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install fswebcam
        ```
    - On Fedora/Red Hat:
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install fswebcam
        ```

## Project Structure

```
camshoot/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── photo.jpg
├── src/
│   └── app.js
├── package.json
└── package-lock.json
```

## Usage

1. Start the Node.js server:
    ```bash
    node src/app.js
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

3. You should see a live feed from your webcam.

## How It Works

- The `NodeWebcam` module captures an image from your webcam every 250 milliseconds.
- The captured image is saved as `photo.jpg` in the `public` directory.
- An Express.js server serves the `index.html` file from the `public` directory.
- The web page contains JavaScript that refreshes the image every 250 milliseconds, creating a live feed effect.

## Potential Use Cases

- **AI-Assisted Applications:** This setup can be used in conjunction with AI tools like ComfyUI for real-time image processing and analysis.
- **Security Systems:** Monitor a live feed from a remote webcam.
- **Live Streaming:** Broadcast a live video feed from your webcam on a web page.

## Notes

- Ensure that your webcam is properly connected and working.
- The application overwrites the same image file (`photo.jpg`) to minimize storage usage.
